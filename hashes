import hashlib

s = "mypassword"
hashed = hashlib.md5(s.encode()).hexdigest()

print(f"Hashed value is: {hashed}")



 hashes can be used when you need fast lookups, counting, or duplicate detection using dict or set.
Theyâ€™re great for mapping relationships, grouping similar items, or checking data integrity.
Also used in security for hashing passwords or encoding values like URLs.
