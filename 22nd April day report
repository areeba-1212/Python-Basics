Task Details:Today, I continued my Python learning journey by starting with the basics of Python programming. I covered the following topics:
Introduction to Python syntax
Variables and their usage
String manipulation techniques
Loops (for, while) and their use cases
If-else statements and basic control flow
I also practiced what I learned by solving 3 to 4 questions on my own. The solutions, along with the code for today's practice, have been committed and pushed to my GitHub repository for reference.
This marks my progress update for the day.
